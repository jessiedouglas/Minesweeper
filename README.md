Minesweeper
===========

Implements a version of the game Minesweeper in terminal.
If you choose to save a game, it will save it (using YAML) to the folder you are playing the game in as 'saved_game.txt'. You can rename the file as you choose :)

NOTE: When playing, row and column indices both start at 0, and (0, 0) is at the top left.

#### Running this Game
1. `git clone` or download this repository.
2. In the command line, `cd` into the folder you just downloaded
3. In the command line, run `ruby minesweeper.rb`
4. Play the game (see above for tips for entering in coordinates)
